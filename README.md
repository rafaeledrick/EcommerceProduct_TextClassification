**LSTM and GRU Networks for Ecommerce Product Text Classification**

A Text Mining project using LSTM and GRU model to to develop a more accurate and efficient e-commerce product text classification model more accurate and efficient by using LSTM and GRU networks.

This research successfully developed an accurate e-commerce product text classification model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Both models showed good 
generalization ability and high performance stability during training, indicating that they are effective in classifying e-commerce texts.
